Who We Are
D7mtg is a brand development studio based in Brooklyn. We create and evolve brands for emerging and established businesses, and we're passionate about helping them build their value and accelerate growth.
What the hell is branding?
So, you're thinking of starting a business. You have a great idea, a solid business plan. You've done your research, you've brought in your fair share of experts to give you the best advice they can. You think you're ready.
But you're not. Not even close.
In fact, you're most likely going to fail if you don't take the time to deeply understand your business model, your market, your potential customers, and your competitors.
More than just a logo or a color theme, your brand is the expression of who you are, what you're about, and what you want to achieve. It's what sets you apart from your competitors. It's what people feel when they use your product or service. It's what makes people trust you. It's what makes you memorable.
Your brand is the reason people care about your business.
Our process
We're not here to create pretty things.
We're here to build your brand with clarity and consistency. And we're here to help you grow.
We start by asking questions. Lots of questions. We want to understand your business inside out. We want to know your story, your vision, your strategy, your values.
Next, we do our research. We study your competitors and your industry by delving deep into your customer demographics and behavior, and by getting to know the market.
Then, we start building. We combine our knowledge of the market with our understanding of your business to create a strategy that is unique to you, that brings your brand to life, that makes people want to get to know you, that turns your potential customers into loyal customers.
When you're ready, we develop a look and feel that embodies your brand. We'll help you develop your visual identity, your logo, your color theme, your fonts, your tagline.
Once we have a solid idea of what your brand will look like, we'll start to apply it to your marketing materials, your website, your social media channels, your online store.
And we'll keep working with you to make sure your brand evolves along with your business, that it stays true to your values, and that it continues to resonate with your customers.
We'll make sure your brand works.
